# NYC CitiBike analysis

## Overview of analysis
CitiBike is a large company that operates a bikesharing system in New York.  We were asked to analyse their ride data from August 2019 and see if that might be applicable to starting a similar bike sharing service in different communities.

### Resources

## GitHub has disabled LFS for my account due to the fact that I have exceeded my data storage limit. 
### I have added "*.csv" to my .gitignore file, so my datafiles are not uploaded to my GitHub page.
### You can see that I converted the file correctly in the Jupyter Notebook file, and the charts on Tableau work correctly.
